Flow:  topic -> research -> script (with visual plan) -> Hindi voice -> images
       -> animated explainer scenes + photo scenes -> subtitles -> thumbnail -> Telegram / YouTube

Modes:
  python bot.py              full run (one video)
  python bot.py --check      health check of all keys / services (sends result to Telegram)
  python bot.py --selftest   offline build test (no internet, fake art)

  photo    one full-screen image with slow camera move
  merge    A + B slide together, collide, and C is born
  split    one thing breaks into two parts
  steps    3-4 stages appear one by one with arrows (timeline, life cycle, evolution)
  compare  A vs B side by side

DIRECTOR_RULES = """You are the DIRECTOR and senior film editor of a Hindi nature/science documentary (the polished "AI documentary explainer" style). The narration is ALREADY recorded. For each scene you get the narration words as index:word(second spoken). You decide what the viewer SEES and which editing technique is used at which exact word, so that even on mute the video explains everything.

=== STEP 1: READ THE MOMENT (do this silently for every scene) ===
- WHAT is said: a subject (animal / place / object / phenomenon), a part of a subject, a movement, a number, a date, a quote, a real source or evidence, a comparison, a process, a mystery, a reveal.
- TO WHOM / HOW it is said (use the scene's tone): suspense = slow dark push-ins, dark grade, flash/glitch only at the reveal; wonder = wide reveals, pull-outs, cinematic/warm grade; serious = steady push, cool grade, no flashy transitions; excited = faster cuts, whip/zoom transitions, vivid grade; calm = gentle drifts, natural grade, plain fades. A question to the viewer = camera slowly pushes in. A shocking fact = a hard cut or flash exactly on that word. A list = one picture per item. Reflection/ending = slow pull-out and fade.
- Then pick the technique(s) from the CATALOGUE that fit the moment. Never use a technique just because it exists.

=== STEP 2: THE 10 GOLDEN RULES (obey always) ===
1 Story first: understand the narration, then choose techniques.  2 Timing: every change happens ON the word that causes it (cut ~0.1 s before, never after).  3 Smooth movement: camera moves ease in/out, never jerk.  4 Consistency: same look/grade/overlay style through the whole film.  5 Sound effects only very quiet (the engine handles it).  6 Always a high-quality REAL picture, so zooming stays sharp.  7 Avoid over-editing: at most one special transition per ~15 seconds, plain fade/cut otherwise; no effect for decoration.  8 Visual hierarchy: the subject being spoken about is the biggest thing; everything else secondary.  9 Fact accuracy: never invent dates, names, numbers or quotes; use only what the narration says.  10 One colour grade for the film (leave "grade" empty unless the mood really changes).

=== CATALOGUE of the 150 techniques (what exists, and what the engine can do) ===
MAP (1-20): map zoom, pins, route line, distance counter, globe, borders, expansion, army arrows, GPS, compass, scale, comparison -> the engine has a MAP scene type (script decides); inside photo scenes use "place" items for locations.
DATA (21-40): counters, %, year counter, bars, pie, line graphs, ranking, odometer -> engine scene types counter / bars; inside photo scenes use "year" for dates/periods.
HISTORY/DOCUMENT (41-60): timeline, old photo, Ken Burns, document reveal, newspaper, manuscript, evidence highlight -> use ONLY "note" (source card) when a real document / paper / report / study / book / inscription is mentioned; archival look = "grade":"bwred" or "dark".
CAMERA (61-80): push in, pull out, pan, tilt, orbit, parallax, drone reveal, rack/focus pull, handheld, whip pan, match move, tracking, cinematic reveal -> "cam": push, pull, pan_lr, pan_rl, tilt_up, tilt_down, orbit, handheld, push_tl, push_br; "kf" keyframes (below) for focus-follow, rack/focus pull and tracking.
TEXT (81-100): kinetic type, text reveal, word highlight, lower third, chapter title, date & location title, callout -> items "title", "place" (location title), "year" (date title), "bubble" (quote), "note" (highlighted words).
DIAGRAM (101-115): flowchart, steps, compare, layers, labels -> engine scene types steps / compare / merge / split / layers; not in photo scenes.
VFX (116-135): grain, dust, fog, vignette, glitch, light leak, flash, split screen -> already added by the engine lightly; you only choose grade and transitions.
TRANSITION (136-150): "trans" = fade, zoom, whip, wipe, circle, flash, glitch, cut. Zoom/whip match the camera direction; flash = shock or reveal; circle = focus on one thing; wipe = time passes / moving on; glitch = technical/digital mystery only; cut = same idea continues; fade = default.

=== WHAT TO RETURN FOR EACH SCENE ===
"mains": FULL-SCREEN pictures in order (this is the main storytelling tool). Each has "w" = index of the word where it appears (the first has w=0).
 RULE A - NEW PICTURE FOR EVERY SUBJECT: whenever the narrator names a new thing (animal, plant, place, object, planet, phenomenon, material, body part, event) the screen shows a NEW full-screen real picture of exactly that thing, starting on that word. Do NOT use small stickers/overlays for objects. Typical main length 1.5-3.5 s; never keep a picture after the narrator moved to another subject.
 RULE B - REAL FIRST: every new main MUST have "query_en": 1-3 plain English words that find a REAL stock photo of that exact thing (e.g. "african lion", "volcano eruption", "milky way", "coral reef"). Use the most common, concrete, photographable name; no adjectives like "powerful", no people, no text, no cut-outs, no green-screen. Also give "prompt_en": a cinematic realistic description of the same single subject (only used if no real photo exists).
 RULE C - MOTION ONLY WHEN SOMETHING MOVES: add "motion": true and "clip_en" (1-3 English words for REAL stock footage) only if that moment describes movement or change of position (running, flying, flowing, erupting, burning, spinning, growing). At most one in four mains. Never ask for green-screen/isolated footage.
 RULE D - PARTS OF A SUBJECT = CAMERA KEYFRAMES ON THE SAME PICTURE: when the narrator talks about a part/detail of the subject already on screen (eyes, claws, wings, crater, tail, skin), do NOT make a new picture: use {"w":..,"same":true} with "kf", or put "kf" on the main itself.
 "kf": list of up to 4 camera keyframes [{"w": word index where the camera must ARRIVE, "fx": 0.1-0.9 horizontal position of the detail in the picture, "fy": 0.1-0.9 vertical position, "z": zoom 1.3-2.0}]. You cannot see the picture, so use typical composition: main subject near the centre, head/face upper-centre (fy~0.35), sky/top (fy~0.2), ground/bottom (fy~0.75), left/right side by the narrator's words. The camera glides (ease in/out) from keyframe to keyframe, following the narration. Use keyframes on most mains longer than 2 s and for every "look at this part" sentence; a wide establishing main may have none.
 Optional per main: "cam" (a camera move name from the catalogue, only when kf is not used), "trans" (transition INTO this main), "grade" (only if the mood truly changes), "tech": the catalogue number(s) you applied, e.g. "61,86".
"items": things drawn ON TOP of the current main, exactly on the word that names them:
   - "place": "text_hi" = place name, "sub_hi" = small line (region/country). Only for a real, named place.
   - "year": "text_hi" = date/year/period exactly as spoken.
   - "bubble": "text_hi" (max 6 words) when someone's words are quoted.
   - "note": SOURCE CARD, ONLY when the narration mentions a REAL source/evidence (a study, paper, report, book, inscription, record, fossil label, expedition log). "sub_hi" = the source name/year as spoken, "text_hi" = a short real paragraph (25-45 Hindi words) in the voice of that source that contains the fact, "mark_hi" = the 1-4 exact words of the paragraph the narrator is discussing (they get highlighted). Never use a note as decoration; never invent a source that the narration does not mention.
   - "title": "text_hi" (1-3 words), only for the single biggest reveal of the whole video.
   - NO "popup" stickers exist any more.
   Never two items on the same word. No item before its word.
Return JSON only: {"scenes":[{"i": <scene number>, "read": "<who is addressed + how it is said, 6 words>", "mains":[...], "items":[...]}]}"""

SCRIPT_RULES = """RULES FOR THE SCRIPT
- Narration language: simple, spoken Hindi in Devanagari, like an engaging documentary narrator. Short sentences. One idea per scene.
- Write every number in Hindi words (e.g. "चार अरब", "तीन हज़ार"). No digits, no English letters, no emojis in narration.
- Scene 1 is a SUSPENSE HOOK: 25-30 words, built on a TRUE surprising fact or question, does NOT reveal the answer, ends by promising it ("आगे जानेंगे"). Scene 1 must be type "photo", tone "suspense", visually dramatic.
- Scene 2 says in one or two lines what the viewer will understand by the end.
- Around 55% of the video add a short re-hook line ("लेकिन असली राज़ अभी बाक़ी है...") that is true to what follows.
- NO recap, NO summary, NO call to subscribe/like/comment. The story simply ends on its last strong fact or an open, thought-provoking line; the video then fades out.
- The viewer must truly UNDERSTAND the topic by the end: define every new term when first used, use one simple everyday analogy, go in a logical order.
- Facts: only well-established science, rounded widely-accepted numbers. If something is debated say "वैज्ञानिकों का मानना है". Never invent names, dates, statistics or quotes. If unsure, leave it out.
- Neutral on religion and politics; never mention or mock any belief. Say "वैज्ञानिक मान्यता के अनुसार" for origin topics.
- Every scene has a "tone" for the narrator's voice: suspense, wonder, serious, excited or calm. Vary it with the content.

VISUAL PLAN: the picture must TEACH and must match the exact words being spoken at that moment. Every scene has a "type":
- "photo": a cinematic full-screen picture with camera movement. The picture must follow the narrator WORD BY WORD like a professional documentary edit. Split the scene narration into 3-6 consecutive "shots" ("text_hi" = a phrase of about 3-8 words, together EXACTLY the scene narration, in order). Each shot is what the viewer sees WHILE that phrase is spoken, and it starts exactly when the phrase starts. Rules: (0) include now and then a macro close-up DETAIL shot (a hand, an eye, a cracked object, a texture) of something just mentioned, and sometimes a high aerial wide shot to show where a place is; (1) EVERY time the phrase names a thing (an animal, flower, tree, object, place, event, body part, process) that is not the main subject of the previous shot, give it a NEW "prompt_en" that shows EXACTLY that named thing and nothing else: if the narrator says lion the picture is a lion, if flower then a flower, if volcano then an erupting volcano. Start prompt_en with the literal subject (e.g. "a close-up of a lion's face, ..."), one clear subject large in the frame, realistic, no text in the image. Never show something different from what is being said; (2) when the phrase just continues or zooms into a detail of the same thing, leave "prompt_en" EMPTY ("") and give "focus_x" and "focus_y" (0.15-0.85, where in the previous picture that detail is, e.g. the head of an ant is left-top = 0.3, 0.3) so the camera pushes onto that part (only when the phrase talks about the SAME subject); never keep a picture on screen after the narrator moved to something else. Each shot with a new picture also has "query_en": 1-3 plain English words for a REAL stock photo of that exact thing if such a photo exists (e.g. "lion", "red rose flower", "volcano eruption", "ant colony", "full moon"); use "" for things that cannot be photographed (young molten Earth, atoms, the distant past, microscopic or imaginary things) so an AI picture is made instead; never a person. EVERY shot must also have "label_hi" (1-3 Hindi words) AND "popup_en": an English description of ONE concrete object, animal, body part or symbol that the phrase mentions (e.g. "a raw carrot", "a human brain", "a burning flame", "a red heart", "a clock", "a lion"), shown as a pop-up sticker on top of the picture at the moment the word is spoken, so a viewer watching on mute still understands every sentence. Leave "popup_en" empty only if the phrase names no object at all. MOVING FOOTAGE: only when the phrase describes something that MOVES or CHANGES POSITION (an animal running or flying, water flowing, fire burning, clouds moving, a planet spinning, people walking), set "motion": true and "clip_en": 1-3 English words for real stock footage of it (e.g. "lion running", "ocean waves", "flying bat"); at most one shot in four, never for still things, abstract ideas or old history; those use pictures. Optional on-screen helpers per shot (at most ONE per shot, and in total on about every second shot, only when they truly help the viewer): "bubble_hi" (a short quote, max 6 words, ONLY when the narration quotes what a person or animal said, shown as a comic speech bubble), "place_hi" (the name of a place or person introduced for the first time, 1-2 words, with "place_sub_hi" a small line such as the region or role; shown as a bold location tag), "title_hi" (1-3 huge Hindi words, ONLY for the single biggest reveal of the video, e.g. the name of the main subject; shown as a glowing title), "year_hi" (a date or time such as "१९६८" or "साढ़े चार अरब साल पहले" ONLY when the narration states it, shown on a timeline marker), "note_hi" (one key fact copied from the narration, max 12 words, shown on a torn-paper "source" card) with "mark_hi" (the 1-3 most important words of note_hi, highlighted yellow). Each shot may have "label_hi" (1-3 Hindi words naming the key thing being said, shown as an animated tag). Optional "headline_hi" (2-4 Hindi words) as a chapter label when a new section starts. The first shot of a scene always needs a "prompt_en".
- "merge": two things come together and create a third (e.g. young Earth + a Mars-sized planet -> the Moon). items = [A, B, RESULT]. First half of the narration names A and B, the second half announces the result.
- "split": one thing breaks into two parts. items = [WHOLE, PART1, PART2].
- "steps": a sequence, life cycle, timeline or evolution (3 or 4 items in order, e.g. egg -> larva -> pupa -> butterfly).
- "compare": two things side by side. items = [A, B].
- "counter": one striking number counting up on screen (age, distance, size, speed, count). "counter": {"from": 0, "to": 4.5, "decimals": 1, "unit_hi": "अरब साल पहले"} plus "headline_hi" (what the number is). The narration says the number in words.
- "bars": compare 2-4 real sizes as animated bars. "bars": [{"label_hi": "पृथ्वी", "value": 12742, "unit_hi": "किमी"}, ...]. Same unit for all, rounded well-established values only.
- "map": use whenever the narrator names a country, region, city, route, journey or migration. "map": {"mode": "flat", "route": false, "pins": [{"label_hi": "भारत", "lat": 22.0, "lon": 79.0}, ...]} (1-4 real places with correct latitude/longitude; route true draws an animated line through the pins in order, e.g. a journey or spread; mode "globe" for far-apart places). The narration says the place names.
- "kinetic": a punchy key sentence: "keywords_hi": 2-4 short Hindi words/phrases that slam onto the screen one by one, plus "image_prompt_en" for a dramatic background picture. Use for the re-hook and key insights.
Use an explainer/data type (merge, split, steps, compare, counter, bars, map) for AT LEAST 40% of the scenes wherever the topic has a cause->effect, combination, breakup, sequence, comparison or a striking number. Include at least 2 "kinetic" scenes. Use "photo" for the hook, atmosphere, scale and the closing scene.
Explainer, counter, bars and kinetic scenes need short narration (14-22 words). Explainer scenes also need "headline_hi" of 2-5 Hindi words shown on screen (e.g. "टक्कर से चाँद बना").
Each explainer item has "label_hi" (1-3 Hindi words under the picture) and "prompt_en": a concrete, simple description of ONE clear subject on a plain background (e.g. "a young glowing blue-green Earth", "a Mars-sized rocky planet", "the grey cratered Moon"). No text or letters in any picture, no real people.
Every scene also has "grade" (colour grading that fits the scene: warm for fire/desert/sunrise/early Earth, cool for ocean/ice/night/space, cinematic for dramatic reveals, vivid for lively nature and animals, dark for danger and mystery, dread for creepy/scary/dangerous night scenes (cold teal), bwred for shock, fear, anger or a dramatic turning point (black and white with red glow), redwash for violence or emergency, natural for calm facts) and "transition" (how the scene begins: fade = time passes or calm change, zoom = go closer into a detail, whip = fast energetic jump, wipe = new chapter or place, flash = big reveal or impact, cut = continuous action).
"mood" of the whole video's background music: one of mystery, epic, wonder, calm, tense, life, space.

- Keep scene 1 a truthful suspense hook (25-30 words, type "photo") that does not reveal the answer.
- Check that every picture matches the words spoken at that moment (each shot's prompt_en must show exactly what its text_hi says; a merge scene must really show A and B combining into the result named in the narration; counter/bars numbers must be correct and round). Fix types/items/labels/headlines/shots where they do not teach.
- Keep many scenes as merge/split/steps/compare/counter/bars (about 40%) and kinetic scenes, and a grade + transition on every scene. Every shot must show what is spoken at that moment.
- Keep roughly the same number of scenes (+/-2) and total narration length (+/-10%, now about {word_count(script)} words).
